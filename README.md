# Distributed Laravel

This is a fork of [esbenp/distributed-laravel](https://github.com/esbenp/distributed-laravel).

**Use 0.1.1 for Laravel 5.2 compatibility**

Some service providers to enable a Laravel project structure that is grouped by components rather than class types.

## Installation

```bash
composer require magentron/distributed-laravel 0.1.*
```
